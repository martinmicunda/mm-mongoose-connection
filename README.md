mm-mongoose-connection
======================
The `mm-mongoose-connection` module follow best practice for creating, maintaining and using a mongoose connection like:
 * open the connection when the app process start
 * start the app server when the connection is open (optional)
 * monitor the connection events (`connected`, `open`, `error` and `disconnected`)
 * close the connection when the app process terminates

## Installation

```bash
$ npm install mm-mongoose-connection --save
```

## Configuration
The `mm-mongoose-connection` module accept two arguments `config` and `callback`. The `config` objects must contains `dbURI`
and `dbOptions` properties as you can see in usages below. The `callback` argument is optional and it's up to you if you want
to start app server when mongodb connection is open.
> **Hint:** It's good practice to start app server when database connection is open.

## Usages

```js
var mongo = require('mm-mongoose-connection');
var config = {
  dbURI: 'mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017/connectionDemo',
  dbOptions: {user: '', pass: ''}
}
// start mongodb
mongo(config, function() {
    // start up the server
    app.listen(3000, function () {
        console.info('app started on port: 3000');
    });
});
```
